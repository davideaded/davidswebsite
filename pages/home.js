    Hey there! I'm a developer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. 
    I'm diving into the world of technology, keen to explore its vast oceans and apply its power to create impactful solutions. And have some fun, of course. <br><br>

    From crafting intuitive interfaces to building robust back-end systems - or attempting to, at least -, I walk through the digital landscape with curiosity and determination. <br><br>
    
    Here, I'll be showcasing some of my projects. I'm certain it will be amusing to look back at my old code in the years to come. <br><br>

    Have fun looking around!
