    Hey there! I'm David, from the title! I'm a developer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. 
    I am currently a Computer Science student at UNICID.
    Here, I'll be showcasing some of my projects. I'm certain it will be amusing to look back at my old code in the years to come. 
    <br><br>
    You can also find my contacts at the bottom of the page.
    <br><br>
    Have fun looking around!
